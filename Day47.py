# ðŸŒ€ Recursion in Python â€“ Basic Notes
# ðŸ”¹ What is Recursion?

# Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller version of a problem.

# ðŸ”¹ Structure of a Recursive Function

# A recursive function must have:

# Base case â€“ the condition that stops recursion.

# Recursive case â€“ the part where the function calls itself.

# def recursive_function():
#     if base_condition:
#         return result
#     else:
#         return recursive_function()
