# # ðŸŒ€ Recursion in Python â€“ Basic Notes
# # ðŸ”¹ What is Recursion?

# # Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller version of a problem.

# # ðŸ”¹ Structure of a Recursive Function

# # A recursive function must have:

# # Base case â€“ the condition that stops recursion.

# # Recursive case â€“ the part where the function calls itself.

# # def recursive_function():
# #     if base_condition:
# #         return result
# #     else:
# #         return recursive_function()


# ðŸ”¹ Simple Example: Factorial
# def factorial(n):
#     if n == 0 or n == 1:     # Base case
#         return 1
#     else:
#         return n * factorial(n - 1)   # Recursive case


# Explanation:

# factorial(3) = 3 Ã— factorial(2)

# factorial(2) = 2 Ã— factorial(1)

# factorial(1) = 1 â†’ Base case hit â†’ Returns 1
