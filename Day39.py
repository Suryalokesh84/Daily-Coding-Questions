# # code chef problem
# Decrement OR Increment
# Write a program to obtain a number 
# N
# N and increment its value by 1 if the number is divisible by 4 
# o
# t
# h
# e
# r
# w
# i
# s
# e
# otherwise decrement its value by 1.

# Input Format
# First line will contain a number 
# N
# N.

# Output Format
# Output a single line, the new value of the number.

# Constraints
# 0
# ≤
# N
# ≤
# 1000
# 0≤N≤1000
# Sample 1:
# Input
# Output
# 5
# 4
# Explanation:
# Since 5 is not divisible by 4 hence, its value is decreased by 1.
