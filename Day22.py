# Blackjack
# Chef is playing a variant of Blackjack, where 
# 3
# 3 numbers are drawn and each number lies between 
# 1
# 1 and 
# 10
# 10 (with both 
# 1
# 1 and 
# 10
# 10 inclusive). Chef wins the game when the sum of these 
# 3
# 3 numbers is exactly 
# 21
# 21.

# Given the first two numbers 
# A
# A and 
# B
# B, that have been drawn by Chef, what should be 
# 3
# 3-rd number that should be drawn by the Chef in order to win the game?

# Note that it is possible that Chef cannot win the game, no matter what is the 
# 3
# 3-rd number. In such cases, report 
# −
# 1
# −1 as the answer.

# Input Format
# The first line will contain an integer 
# T
# T - number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
# The first and only line of each test case contains two integers 
# A
# A and 
# B
# B - the first and second number drawn by the Chef.
# Output Format
# For each testcase, output the 
# 3
# 3-rd number that should be drawn by the Chef in order to win the game. Output 
# −
# 1
# −1 if it is not possible for the Chef to win the game.

# 3
# 1 10
# 1 5
# 4 9
# 10
# -1
# 8
# Explanation:
# Test case 
# 1
# 1: The first two numbers are 
# 1
# 1 and 
# 10
# 10. If the third number will be 
# 10
# 10, the resulting sum will be 
# 1
# +
# 10
# +
# 10
# =
# 21
# 1+10+10=21. So Chef will win the game if the third number is 
# 10
# 10.

# Test case 
# 2
# 2: The first two numbers are 
# 1
# 1 and 
# 5
# 5. There is no number between 
# 1
# 1 and 
# 10
# 10, that can make the resulting sum 
# 21
# 21. Hence, the answer will be 
# −
# 1
# −1 in this test case.

# solution


t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    c = 21 - (a + b)
    if 1 <= c <= 10:
        print(c)
    else:
        print(-1)

# Example usage:
# Input:
# 3
# 1 10
# 1 5
# 4 9
# Output:
# 10
# -1
# 8
# Explanation:
# In the first test case, the third number should be 10 to make the sum
# equal to 21 (1 + 10 + 10 = 21).
# In the second test case, there is no number between 1 and 10 that can
# make the sum equal to 21, so the output is -1.
# In the third test case, the third number should be 8 to make the sum
# equal to 21 (4 + 9 + 8 = 21).
