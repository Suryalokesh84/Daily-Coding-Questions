# # Minimum Spanning Tree [Graphs]
# You are given a connected, undirected, weighted graph with N vertices and M edges. Your task is to find the weight of the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) using either Kruskal’s Algorithm or Prim’s Algorithm. The MST of a graph is a subset of edges that connects all vertices together without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

# Input Format

# First line: Two integers N and M → number of vertices and edges. Next M lines: Three integers u v w, representing an undirected edge between u and v with weight w.

# Constraints

# 3 <= N <= 20

# Output Format

# Print the total weight of the MST.

# minimum spanning tree with the below edges

# 0->1 = 10 0->3 = 5 2->3 = 4

# 10+5+4 = 19
