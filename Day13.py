# #  CODE CHEF PROBLEM
# Mario and Transformation
# Mario transforms each time he eats a mushroom as follows:

# If he is currently small, he turns normal.
# If he is currently normal, he turns huge.
# If he is currently huge, he turns small.
# Given that Mario was initially normal, find his size after eating 
# X
# X mushrooms.

# Input Format
# The first line of input will contain one integer 
# T
# T, the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
# Each test case contains a single line of input, containing one integer 
# X
# X.
# Output Format
# For each test case, output in a single line Mario's size after eating 
# X
# X mushrooms.

# Print:

# NORMAL
# NORMAL, if his final size is normal.
# HUGE
# HUGE, if his final size is huge.
# SMALL
# SMALL, if his final size is small.
# You may print each character of the answer in either uppercase or lowercase (for example, the strings 
# Huge
# Huge, 
# hUgE
# hUgE, 
# huge
# huge and 
# HUGE
# HUGE will all be treated as identical).

# 2nd Question
# 3446. Sort Matrix by Diagonals
# Medium
# Topics
# premium lock icon
# Companies
# Hint
# You are given an n x n square matrix of integers grid. Return the matrix such that:

# The diagonals in the bottom-left triangle (including the middle diagonal) are sorted in non-increasing order.
# The diagonals in the top-right triangle are sorted in non-decreasing order.
 

# Example 1:

# Input: grid = [[1,7,3],[9,8,2],[4,5,6]]

# Output: [[8,2,3],[9,6,7],[4,5,1]]

# Explanation:



# The diagonals with a black arrow (bottom-left triangle) should be sorted in non-increasing order:

# [1, 8, 6] becomes [8, 6, 1].
# [9, 5] and [4] remain unchanged.
# The diagonals with a blue arrow (top-right triangle) should be sorted in non-decreasing order:

# [7, 2] becomes [2, 7].
# [3] remains unchanged.
# Example 2:

# Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,2]]

# Output: [[2,1],[1,0]]

# Explanation:



# The diagonals with a black arrow must be non-increasing, so [0, 2] is changed to [2, 0]. The other diagonals are already in the correct order.

# Example 3:

# Input: grid = [[1]]

# Output: [[1]]

# Explanation:

# Diagonals with exactly one element are already in order, so no changes are needed.

 

# Constraints:

# grid.length == grid[i].length == n
# 1 <= n <= 10
# -105 <= grid[i][j] <= 105

from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def sortMatrix(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> List[List[int]]:
        n = len(grid)
        diagonals = defaultdict(list)

        # Step 1: Collect all diagonals
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                diagonals[i - j].append(grid[i][j])

        # Step 2: Sort diagonals based on their position
        for key in diagonals:
            if key >= 0:  # bottom-left (i >= j)
                diagonals[key].sort(reverse=True)  # non-increasing
            else:  # top-right (i < j)
                diagonals[key].sort()  # non-decreasing

        # Step 3: Refill the grid
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                grid[i][j] = diagonals[i - j].pop(0)

        return grid

# Example usage:
# grid = [[1,7,3],[9,8,2],[4,5,6]]
# Output: [[8,2,3],[9,6,7],[4,5,1]]

# 3rd Question  
# ðŸ”¹ Question: Diagonal Traverse II

# You are given a 2D list of integers nums, where each nums[i] is a list of integers. Return all elements of nums in diagonal order (i.e., first all elements with i + j = 0, then all with i + j = 1, etc.), traversing each diagonal from bottom to top.

# Example 1

# Input:

# nums = [[1,2,3],
#         [4,5,6],
#         [7,8,9]]


# Output:

# [1,4,2,7,5,3,8,6,9]


# Explanation:

# Diagonal 0: [1]

# Diagonal 1: [4,2]

# Diagonal 2: [7,5,3]

# Diagonal 3: [8,6]

# Diagonal 4: [9]

# Example 2

# Input:

# nums = [[1,2,3,4,5],
#         [6,7],
#         [8],
#         [9,10,11],
#         [12,13,14,15,16]]


# Output:

# [1,6,2,8,7,3,9,4,12,10,5,13,11,14,15,16]
